On a sunny June morning in 1983, Steve Jobs waits at the back of a giant tent, ready to take the stage at the International Design Conference in Aspen. The theme is “The Future Isn’t What It Used to Be,” and Steve is there to talk about computers to an audience of several hundred designers and design lovers.

Over the next hour, he makes several prescient predictions about the future of personal computers but, most important, he speaks to their inevitability. Taking advantage of this unique moment, Steve works hard to persuade the audience of designers to seize a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make these new objects not just functional but beautiful too.

“We have an opportunity to do it great or to do it so-so,” he says. “And what a lot of us at Apple are working on is trying to do it great.”
