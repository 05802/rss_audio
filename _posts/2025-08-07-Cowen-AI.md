Tyler Cowen, Professor of Economics at George Mason University, Faculty Director of the Mercatus Center, writer at Marginal Revolution, and host of Conversations with Tyler, gave a talk on AI and economic growth, at Google DeepMindâ€™s London offices, in early July. Tyler discussed how his views on AI have updated in recent years, across many areas, including how to best measure progress, the current market landscape, and how AI may impact living standards. We ended with a Q&A with Zhengdong Wang, a researcher working on Gemini and Post-AGI Research. Thanks to Tyler for sharing his thoughts with us.
