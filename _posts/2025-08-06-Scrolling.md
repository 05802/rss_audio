The discussion focuses on "gendered ideological polarisation," examining the growing ideological divide between men and women. Key questions explored include whether this is a global phenomenon, which groups are most polarised, and if it's driven by factors like economic frustration, online persuasion, or a rise in hostile sexism.

Dr. Alice Evans is a social scientist and the host of the discussion. Her work typically centers on topics like economic development, cultural change, and gender equality.

John Burn-Murdoch is the Chief Data Reporter for the Financial Times (FT). His expertise lies in data journalism and using statistical analysis to report on significant societal trends.<!--more-->
