In this ⁠Huberman Lab Essentials⁠ episode, I provide a science-based daily protocol designed to enhance performance, mood and overall health by strategically timing simple yet powerful tools and behaviors.

I explain how to increase energy and alertness in the morning, optimize your workspace and work sessions for maximum focus, and structure your day for sustained productivity. I also discuss the roles of fasting, meal and caffeine timing, and key nutrients, as well as how to leverage exercise to sharpen alertness and cognitive performance. Additionally, I describe evening practices and supplements that help you fall asleep quickly and promote quality sleep.
