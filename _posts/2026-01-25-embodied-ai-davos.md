Embodied AI refers to AI integrated into physical systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world through sensors and actuators, like robots and autonomous vehicles. This fireside conversation explores how advances in AI like vision–language–action models are redefining what machines can understand and do, especially as we move from navigation to mobile manipulation. The speakers discuss how quickly today's rapid progress in AI might transfer to robotics and embodied systems, and how soon we can expect to see these technologies making a tangible impact on our daily lives.
